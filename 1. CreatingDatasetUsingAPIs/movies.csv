4370,A Simple Case,"As a response to criticism for the allegedly excessive “mass appeal” of his  earlier epic STORM OVER ASIA (1928), Vsevolod Pudovkin unleashed his flair  for experimentation in what was supposed to be the director’s first sound  feature. Everything went wrong: technical problems forced him to complete  the film as a silent; viewers were baffled by the lack of a recognizable  plot; then, the ideological climate of the Soviet Union changed. He was  now being blamed for catering to bourgeois taste! Time has come to set  the record straight. Here’s lyrical cinema at its best, deliberately operatic  and yet intimate as it matches the characters’ inner life with the solemn  rhythms of nature, and depicted through breathtaking black-and-white  photography.
